This mod adds nightmares to the game. A nightmare has a 5% chance of happening every time a player goes to sleep. Nightmares can do a variety of things to the player, such as spawn mobs, give potion effects, damage the player, among other things. This mod also adds several nightmare mobs based on real world lore, to haunt your dreams.
